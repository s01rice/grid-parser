(Coding Exercise)

This is a JavaScript solution to the following coding exercise: 

Given a Google Doc like [this one](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRMx5YQlZNa3ra8dYYxmv-QIQ3YJe8tbI3kqcuC7lQiZm-CSEznKfN_HYNSpoXcZIV3Y_O3YoUB1ecq/pub) that contains a list of Unicode characters and their positions in a 2D grid, take in the URL for such a Google Doc, parse the data in the document, and print the grid of characters. When printed in a fixed-width font, the characters in the grid will form a graphic showing a sequence of uppercase letters, which is the secret message.

For example, The simplified example document linked above draws out the letter 'F':

█▀▀▀
